            Band Biography
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">
            Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1996.[1][2] The four members 
            – lead vocalist/pianist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy 
            Berryman and drummer Will Champion – were at University College London and came 
            together from 1996 to 1998, during which time the band changed names from Pectoralz, 
            to Starfish, then Coldplay.[3][4] Creative director and former manager Phil Harvey 
            is often referred to as the fifth member by the band.[4] They recorded and released 
            two EPs: Safety in 1998 and The Blue Room in 1999. The latter was their first 
            release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.[5]

            Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of the song "Yellow" in 2000, 
            followed in the same year by their debut album Parachutes, which was nominated 
            for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), 
            was released to critical acclaim and won many awards, including NME's Album of the 
            Year. Their next release, X&Y, the best-selling album worldwide in 2005, received 
            mostly positive reviews, though some critics felt it was inferior to its predecessor. 
            Their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), the 
            best-selling album worldwide of 2008, was produced by Brian Eno and released to 
            largely positive reviews, earning three Grammy Awards. In October 2011, Coldplay 
            released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which topped the charts in over 
            34 countries, was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011, and received mixed 
            reviews.[6] In 2014, they released their sixth album, Ghost Stories, which also 
            received mixed reviews and topped several national album charts. In December 2015, 
            the band released their seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams, which reached the top 
            two in most major markets, but received generally mixed reviews.

            worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.[8] Three of 
            their albums: Parachutes, A Rush of Blood to the Head and X&Y are among the best-
            selling albums in UK chart history.[9] In December 2009, Rolling Stone readers 
            voted the group the fourth-best artist of the 2000s.[10] Coldplay have supported 
            various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and
