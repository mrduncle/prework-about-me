      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am formerly a power station engineer but am now working for myself and focussing
         on software development</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Perth, Western Australia</p>
      <h1>What are my favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Whitewater kayaking, kayak surfing and programming</p>
      <h1>What's my dream job?</h1>
      <p>Information Management and Data Warehousing for large engineering projects</p>
      <h1>Where do I live?</h1>
      <p>North Coogee</p>
      <h1>Why do I want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I understand a lot of back end development but am currently limited to Microsoft 
        Access\Excel as a front end for any work that I do. Web front ends seem to have 
        so much more flexibility and are the minimum expectation for industry these days.</p>
